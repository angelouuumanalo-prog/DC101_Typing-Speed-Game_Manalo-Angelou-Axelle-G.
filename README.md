Game Description

Speed Typing Challenge is a browser-based interactive typing game designed to test and improve a player’s typing speed and accuracy. Players are challenged to type randomly generated words or sentences within a limited time, earning points based on correct keystrokes, speed, and accuracy. The game provides real-time feedback through visual indicators, timers, and score updates to keep players engaged and motivated.
The game features a clean and responsive user interface, countdown timers, dynamic word generation, and performance tracking such as words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage. Difficulty progressively increases by shortening time limits and introducing longer or more complex words. Players can restart the game at any time, making it suitable for practice and skill improvement. This project demonstrates effective event handling, DOM manipulation, and real-time updates using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was created solely for educational purposes.
